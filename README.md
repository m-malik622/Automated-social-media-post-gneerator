# Automated-social-media-post-gneerator

There's an arising trend on social media where two video clip occupy one screen. The clip on top being of interest, and the clip on bottom retaining viewer attention. The almost formulaic format to these videos gave me an idea to utilize the moviepy lib to automate the editing technuiqe needed to achieve this format.Although the project is intended for a comedic purpose, the functions implemented in the "Social_Media_Post_Automation" could be used to fetch videos on youtube from a search term, download youtube videos, or paste two clips ontop of each other.
