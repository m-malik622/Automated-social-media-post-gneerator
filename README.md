# Automated-social-media-post-gneerator
There's an arising issue on TikTok where a post consists of an interesting video on the top-half followed by a more simple one on the bottom-half to retain viewer attention. Although the idea was initially quite smart, the format wears out quickly and the format is almost formulaic. I wanted to see if I could automate the whole process, from fetching specific videos off YouTube with an input of a tag tied to the video such as 'satisfying' and watermarking the channel name on the video to comply with fair use terms to compiling the 2 videos into a TikTok video format to be posted.
